* Generic Programming in CyberLisp

Classes contain virtual lookup tables (vtables) that map method names
to methods.  Methods are lambda functions that take the receiver
object ("this") as first argument.

A generic function is a function that looks up a method in the class
of the receiver.

Method lookup is done via JavaScript's built-in __proto__ dispatch.

** Example

(defclass <dog>)
(def say-something ((<dog> d)) "wooof") ;; install method _and_ define generic function

(defclass <cat>)
(def say-something ((<cat> c)) "meoow")

(say-something (new <dog>)) ;; call generic function. it looks up the method internally
(say-something (new <cat>))

DEF creates a method by installing a lambda in the receiver class'
vtable _and_ DEFUNs a generic function called SAY-SOMETHING in the
global environment.
