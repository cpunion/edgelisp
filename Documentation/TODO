* Better lambda list abstraction

Make it an object, define some nice utilities, and put the destructs into it.

* It sucks that NEW is not defined as a function automatically

Need sth. like lispDefinePrimitive that defines both a decoder and a Lisp function?

* Preventing multiple evaluation of method receiver inside genfun is superfluous

Add invoke-method-no-once IR?
