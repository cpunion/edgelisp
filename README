EdgeLisp is a Lisp for JavaScript.

There's no formal definition of the language at the moment, so your
best bet is to look at the Lisp files in the lisp/ and client/
directories.

A slow-loading REPL (because it compiles the boot code on-the-fly)
is online at:

   http://manuel.github.com/edgelisp/repl.html

Features
--------

* Class-based object system (DEFCLASS)
  (currently only single inheritance)

* Multiple-dispatching generic functions (DEFGENERIC, DEFMETHOD)
  (using Cecil-style symmetric method lookup)

* Separate function and variable namespaces (Lisp-2)
  DEFPARAMETER, DEFVAR, DEFUN, LET, LET*, FUNCALL, APPLY
  (FLET and LABELS currently missing)

* &OPTIONAL, &KEY, &REST, &AUX parameters
  as well as &ALL-KEYS receiving keyword args as dictionary

* Runtime type-checked function parameters and results (using same
  syntax as DEFMETHOD for parameters and -> arrow syntax for result)

* Basic control flow (IF, PROGN, LOOP),
  Nonlocal exits (BLOCK/RETURN-FROM, CATCH/THROW), UNWIND-PROTECT

* Condition system with restarts
  HANDLER-BIND, RESTART-BIND, SIGNAL, INVOKE-RESTART

* Numerical tower: real, rational, integer
  (small integers are represented as Number)

* Hygienic DEFMACRO (based on SRFI 72) with basic destructuring;
  #` and #' for hygienic code quotation, analogous to ` and '

* Slot access through (overridable) generic functions;
  slots may be defined outside classes, with DEFSLOT.

* (Slightly) Generalized references
  SETF (appends "-setter")

* Inline JavaScript, with escaping back into Lisp, (and back into JS...)
  using #{ ... JavaScript code ... #} reader syntax.

* Dynamically-scoped (fluid-bound, actually) variables
  DEFDYNAMIC, DYNAMIC, DYNAMIC-BIND

Features TBD
------------

* Multiple inheritance
* FLET, LABELS, TAGBODY, DESTRUCTURING-BIND, MACROLET, CASE, COND
* CALL-NEXT-METHOD; before-, after-, around-methods
* Sequence protocol based on D's ranges
* Package system

Plan
----

* Implement missing features
* Documentation and better test suite
* Make faster, smaller

Compatibility
-------------

EdgeLisp is intended to compile to EMCAScript, 3rd Edition (JavaScript
1.5), but currently uses the nonstandard extensions __proto__ (for
inheritance) and function.caller (for debugging).

License

If you modify EdgeLisp, you must make the modified version available
to your users under the AGPL.  See file COPYING.

(Using EdgeLisp for your programs does not place them under the AGPL.
You are free to choose any license for your Lisp code.)
