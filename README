A Lisp to JavaScript 1.5 compiler.

Requires SpiderMonkey.

Currently, the coolest program, which shows off destructuring and
object literals, is:

(defclass <dog> name)
(def say-name (<dog .name>) name)
(defvar *d* (<dog .name "Gonz">))
(say-name *d*)
==> "Gonz"

These definitions of SAY-NAME are equivalent:

(def say-name (<dog d>) (.name d)) ;; bind parameter to name d
(def say-name (<dog>) (.name dog)) ;; <dog> = <dog dog>
(def say-name (<dog .name>) name) ;; destructure directly, could also do <dog d .name>
