EdgeLisp is developed by Manuel Simoni <msimoni@gmail.com>

Features
--------

* Classes integrated with the JS types
* Multiple-dispatching generic functions
* Separate function and variable namespaces (Lisp-2)
* Optional, keyword, and rest parameters
* Runtime type-checked function parameters
* Nonlocal exits; stack unwind protection
* Condition system with restarts
* `defmacro`
* Slot access through (overridable) generic functions
* (Slightly) Generalized references
* Inline JavaScript, with escaping back into Lisp, (and back into JS...)
* Dynamic variables
* Everything-is-an-object, including null
* In-browser REPL
* Scheme numerical tower

Planned Features
----------------

* Multiple inheritance
* Hygienic defmacro, based on SRFI 72
* Sequence protocol based on D's ranges

Compatibility
-------------

EdgeLisp aspires to compile to EMCAScript, 3rd Edition (JavaScript
1.5), but currently uses the nonstandard extensions __proto__ (for
inheritance) and function.caller (for debugging).
